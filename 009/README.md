Hi everyone,

Fifteen days ago Hack Club launched the [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/), a 2-month long, 1967-inspired collection of coding activities throughout the summer for high school students. Already, 1,639 project updates have been posted by students to [scrapbook.hackclub.com](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/).

In the 1960s, Stewart Brand envisioned applying technology for art, music, and greater freedoms. Hack Club’s vision is also to be greater than just a home for technically-talented teenagers: Hack Club is about learning to do what you want in the world and how code can help you do it. That means creating spaces to develop people with a “hacker mindset”—curious, optimistic, relentless problem solvers.

Hack Club is opt-in and student-first (no teachers / no parents). And, when it works, we don’t just create good coders, we also help build good people. Check out Summer of Making; we hope it facilitates the most original, creative activities for high schoolers this summer.

_“Whenever i open up the scrapbook site, i feel like i’m getting a big hug by all the other hack clubbers at once” —Austin, 17-year-old Hack Club leader, New York_

_**This is our 9th VIP update, your 2-minute read on how we’re building [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)—sent to 80 recipients, including our major donors & friends. Thanks for this time together.**_

**Can you help build Hack Club?** We’d appreciate any of the following:

  * Introduce us to someone from [The Omidyar Group](https://www.omidyargroup.com/), which runs several foundations very aligned with Hack Club’s work. We’ve just begun conversations with them.
  * Can anyone introduce us to Paul Graham or Jessica Livingston? They’d be great allies for Hack Club.
  * Conversations help challenge our ideas, share our work, and build our donor network. Who could you introduce us to? Here’s a few terrific people we’ve connected with in the last month thanks to wonderful introductions: Patrick Collison of Stripe, Andrew Reed of Sequoia, Jon Cohn of IBM, Brian Douglas of Blacktocats, Debbie Sterling of GoldieBlox, Pooja Sankar of Piazza; and Jake Baskin of the Computer Science Teachers Association and more. Each conversation pushes us forward.

**Hack Club thanks:**

  * Prisma for donating $500
  * Chaleb Pommels, 15, a Hack Club student from Florida, who donated $35
  * We’ve started shipping the first batch of MacBook Airs donated by Tom & Theresa Preston-Werner.
  * Limor Fried, founder of Adafruit, for donating her time as [Hack Club’s AMA guest speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWFtj9cCaB0) last week; upcoming guests include: Dylan Field, Nicky Case, and Alex Stamos!
