Hi,

It's Christina, COO of Hack Club, and this February's newsletter includes all our latest news - thanks for this time together!

**Hack Club is a totally-free, student-led space for high schoolers to tinker and build with tech, make friends and learn to code.** With so many students still isolated and schooling remotely, we're making Hack Club the best place on the internet to be a technical teenager.

Check out this Arduino Nano-compatible PCB built in January by Hugo Hu, 12, of New York. He made it in the shape of his Corgi.  Also, give a clap to Betsy Zhang, 16-- she's about to launch her first Hack Club with friends, none of whom have ever written a line of code. She built her first website for her club: https://flhs-hacks.flhshacks.repl.co/index.html

*Every month we send this 2-minute read on how we’re building Hack Club to our major donors and friends.*

*Hugo's The Corginator is a custom corgi-shaped PCB, designed, manufactured, and shipped to Hack Clubbers across the US. He's selling it to the public online here.*

Getting physical mail is so exciting to students, so we built a mail station at Hack Club and we’ve been shipping out dozens of packages a week. We just finished sending 6,000 packages of Hack Club stickers to students from 128 different countries who requested them.

Hack Club teenagers collaborated to design a custom-manufactured Hack Club microcontroller, designed, manufactured and shipped by Hack Clubbers called the Orpheus Leap. Can we send you one?

The workshop bounty program has helped my club get an income, work as a team creating workshops, be better in English, and learn a lot more JavaScript.” -- WollyZR*
