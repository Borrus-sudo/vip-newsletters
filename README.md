# VIP Newsletters

Starting on March 16th, 2020, we started sending out VIP newsletters every month to Hack Club's largest supporters.

Broadly, we have four types of supporters:

1. Major, major individuals (>$250K)
2. Major individuals (>$10K)
3. Monthly individual donors ($5-100/month)
4. Corporations (as I'm writing this, GitHub is our only current corporate supporter)

The hope is that we'll publish our VIP updates with approximately a 6 week delay between being first sent out and going open source on GitHub, so our largest supporters get the updates first. If it feels right, we'll remove that delay in the future.

VIP newsletters are written by Christina with final edits from me. We aim to send out approximately every month.
